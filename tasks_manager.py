print("hello world")

# roadmap for this project!

# create a main class to act as menu / body, showing all the tasks
# create methods to add, delete, and update(done/changed) tasks (read about CRUD)

# implement some sort of db system to save the tasks list when finished
    # experiment with JSON?

# additional functionality with more advanced methods, such as search or filter specific tasks
